# SPECTRUM AR DISPLAY


This is a state-level project. In this project, I applied AR technology in order to make live 3d environments and objects in our real world.

In order to feel realistic, I used a big LED Display, which is around the size of the wall in our home. So, in this project, I used a laptop, one webcam, Big LED Display(Screen), Big Poster( to track the real-world measure and locate the 3d object).

People have to stand between Big LED Screen and the Big poster. So, user can feel that they are inside of 3d world which is in our real world

it includes animals, trees, characters (zombie dance), sports cars, and many more.

Basically, there are two-part in this project

**1 AR ENVIRONMENT**

This part has 3d objects like animals, characters (zombie dance), sports cars, which are passing through users.

**2 AR MAZE**

this is a virtual game. 4 people have to hold big cardboard, and they have to focus this towards the camera, and the result will show on the big screen. Basically, the camera will convert the big cardboard into a virtual maze game, which is projected on the big screen, where they have to solve this maze by reaching the ball from source to destination. Moreover, in this game ball is moved by gravity. For Ex, people have to move 
cardboard in order to move the ball.
